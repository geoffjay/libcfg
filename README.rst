libcfg
======

A library for working with configuration files. The end goal is something that
allows you to create custom configurations of different markup languages that
can be used as one meta-configuration in a project through a registration
system. The concept was borrowed from how Rygel handles the different
configurations that it uses accross libraries, plugins, and applications.
